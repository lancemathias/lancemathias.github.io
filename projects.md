Some of my past personal projects. To see everything I'm working on, check out my [github](https://github.com/lancemathias).

## [OpenCV Star Stacker](https://github.com/lancemathias/star-stacker)
![star-stacked](/assets/star-stacked.jpg)
A command-line tool written in Python which automatically stacks short images to gether to make star trails. The closed-source nature of a lot of existing astrophotography software really irked me, so I made this script as my own little contribution to open-source software. 

## [notioncal - Automatic Schedule Planner](https://github.com/lancemathias/notioncal)
A Node app which automatically integrates [notion](https://notion.so) to-do lists with [Google Calendar](calendar.google.com). This project started because of an unmet need of mine to have an app that would motivate me to do things by putting due dates on my calendar. In order to interface with my existing planning apps, I learned to use REST APIs and Oauth authentication. This was one of the first projects I did where I started completely from scratch and built all the structures I needed.
