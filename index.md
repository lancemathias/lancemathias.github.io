<p align="left"> Hi! I'm Lance, an undergraduate at UC Berkeley studying computer science. I'm interested in taking advantage of today's data and computational power to examine the world from a macroscopic lens.  
Outside of academics, I enjoy taking pictures and writing open-source software for astrophotography. </p>
